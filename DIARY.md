### 2025-06-06T00:06:00Z - [ENHANCEMENT] Eliminate "rectangularity" and achieve true integration
**Component**: @studio/
**Description**: Completely redesigned interaction paradigm to eliminate boxy appearance and achieve seamless, flat integration
**Rationale**: User identified core issue of "everything is inside its own rectangle" - needed to create truly ghosted interactions that blend into backgrounds
**Major Changes**:
- **True Ghost Buttons**: Eliminated ALL backgrounds, borders, shadows, and padding from interactive elements in default state
- **Header Redesign**: Replaced ToggleGroup with individual buttons using conditional styling for cleaner integration
- **Flattened Card Design**: Removed card shadows, reduced border opacity to near-invisible, unified with background
- **Seamless Borders**: Converted full-width borders to inset borders that don't extend to edges
- **Unified Background**: All sections now share same background color for seamless flow
- **Consistent Icon Treatment**: All icons use muted-foreground by default with hover-to-foreground transitions
- **Enhanced Send Button**: Properly implemented text + icon layout with gap-2 spacing
- **Simplified Visual Hierarchy**: Removed excessive backdrop effects and gradient overlays for cleaner appearance
**Files Modified**:
- studio/src/App.tsx (completely reworked button styling, header interactions, card structure, and prompt layout)
- studio/src/App.css (flattened design system, unified backgrounds, simplified border treatments)

### 2025-06-06T00:07:00Z - [BUGFIX] Critical icon visibility and interaction fixes
**Component**: @studio/
**Description**: Fixed critical visibility issues and implemented proper Send button with text functionality
**Rationale**: User identified that icons were nearly invisible in dark theme and Send button was still icon-only despite previous requirements
**Critical Fixes**:
- **Icon Visibility**: ALL interactive icons now explicitly use `text-foreground` class for maximum contrast against dark background
- **Send Button Implementation**: Replaced Send icon with ArrowUp icon, added "Send" text with proper spacing (`mr-2`)
- **Share Icon Modernization**: Upgraded from Share to Share2 icon for modern appearance
- **True Ghost Buttons**: Enhanced transparency with `border-transparent` and subtle `hover:bg-accent/10` feedback
- **Content Text Hierarchy**: Improved main content text with `text-foreground` for title and `text-foreground/75` for description
- **Textarea Enhancement**: Added explicit `text-foreground` class and improved placeholder contrast
- **Border Subtlety**: Reduced all border opacity to /0.1 and /0.15 for minimal visual separation
- **Semantic Card Structure**: Properly implemented CardHeader, CardTitle, and CardDescription components
**Files Modified**:
- studio/src/App.tsx (icon imports updated, explicit foreground colors applied, Send button with text+icon implemented)
- studio/src/App.css (reduced border opacity throughout for subtle separation)

### 2025-06-06T00:08:00Z - [CRITICAL] Force icon visibility and Send button with inline styles
**Component**: @studio/
**Description**: Applied inline styles to force icon colors and Send button styling when Tailwind classes were insufficient
**Rationale**: User confirmed icons were still invisible and Send button wasn't styled properly - Tailwind classes being overridden by shadcn component defaults
**Critical Implementations**:
- **Forced Icon Colors**: Used inline `style={{color: 'hsl(var(--foreground))'}}` on ALL icons and their parent buttons to override any component styling
- **Send Button Primary Styling**: Applied inline `style={{backgroundColor: 'hsl(var(--primary))', color: 'hsl(var(--primary-foreground))'}}` to force primary button appearance
- **Textarea Placeholder Fix**: Added CSS rule `.prompt textarea::placeholder` with `!important` to force placeholder visibility
- **Ultra-Subtle Borders**: Reduced all border opacity to /0.05 and /0.08 for minimal visual separation
- **Comprehensive Icon Coverage**: Applied forced styling to Smartphone, MessageCircle, Share2, Undo, Redo, Save, RotateCcw, Plus, Paperclip, and ArrowUp icons
**Technical Approach**: Used inline styles as last resort to bypass component-level styling conflicts and ensure visual output matches code intent
**Files Modified**:
- studio/src/App.tsx (inline styles for icon colors, Send button primary styling, textarea improvements)
- studio/src/App.css (ultra-subtle borders, forced placeholder styling)

### 2025-06-06T00:09:00Z - [ENHANCEMENT] Final prompt bar redesign with modern pill styling
**Component**: @studio/
**Description**: Complete overhaul of prompt input bar to match reference design with modern pill-shaped container and proper element arrangement
**Rationale**: User provided detailed specifications for final prompt bar design matching reference image with dark grey pill container, Tools button with text, microphone button, and circular Send button
**Key Implementations**:
- **Modern Pill Container**: Applied `bg-neutral-800 rounded-full px-3 py-2.5 mx-4 mb-4 flex items-center gap-3` for cohesive dark grey pill-shaped input area
- **Tools Button Enhancement**: Properly structured Tools button with Plus icon and "Tools" text using clean Tailwind classes without inline style overrides
- **Refined Typography**: Implemented `placeholder:text-neutral-400` for better placeholder contrast against dark background
- **Microphone Button**: Added standalone microphone button with proper spacing and ghost styling
- **Circular Send Button**: Maintained rounded-full Send button with dark grey background (`bg-neutral-700`) and light icon
- **Clean Color Palette**: Used consistent neutral color scheme (neutral-800 container, neutral-300 icons, neutral-400 placeholder, neutral-700 Send button)
- **Simplified CSS**: Removed complex CSS rules from App.css since styling is now handled entirely through Tailwind utility classes
**Technical Approach**: Moved away from inline style overrides to clean Tailwind implementation, achieving better maintainability and consistent visual output
**Files Modified**:
- studio/src/App.tsx (complete prompt bar restructure with modern pill design and proper Tailwind classes)
- studio/src/App.css (simplified by removing complex prompt styling rules)

### 2025-06-06T00:10:00Z - [BUGFIX] Restore proper prompt bar button styling and positioning
**Component**: @studio/
**Description**: Fixed regression where prompt bar buttons lost their proper ghost styling and circular Send button appearance, plus added bottom margin
**Rationale**: User identified that recent changes made prompt bar buttons revert to standard rectangular shadcn/ui shapes instead of proper ghost/circular styling
**Critical Fixes**:
- **Circular Send Button**: Restored `rounded-full` with `bg-neutral-700` background and explicit `border-0 shadow-none` to override shadcn defaults
- **Ghost Button Styling**: Applied `bg-transparent border-0 shadow-none` to Tools and Mic buttons to achieve true ghost appearance against dark prompt bar
- **Button Interactivity**: Enhanced hover states with `hover:bg-neutral-700 hover:text-neutral-100` for ghost buttons and `hover:bg-neutral-600` for Send button
- **Bottom Margin**: Added `mb-3` to prompt bar for breathing room from app window bottom
- **Pill Shape Optimization**: Changed border-radius from `rounded-full` to `rounded-3xl` (1.5rem) to maintain pill shape without squishing textarea
- **Consistent Color Palette**: Maintained `text-neutral-300` for ghost buttons, `text-neutral-200` for Send button icon, and `placeholder:text-neutral-400` for textarea
**Technical Implementation**: Used explicit CSS overrides for button borders/shadows combined with Tailwind classes to ensure shadcn component defaults don't interfere
**Files Modified**:
- studio/src/App.tsx (restored proper button styling with explicit ghost overrides and circular Send button)
- studio/src/App.css (optimized prompt container border-radius and padding for better pill shape)
